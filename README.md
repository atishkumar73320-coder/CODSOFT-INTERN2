#  Movie Rating Prediction

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict the **rating of a movie** based on its features such as **genre, director, and actors**.  
It uses historical IMDb data, applies preprocessing and feature engineering, and trains a regression model to estimate user/critic ratings.
